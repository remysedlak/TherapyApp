Spent 2024 Winter break hypothesizing and researching the current app development market.
After a long time of looking at the many options, I decided to start with a simple Django backend, and React.

I don't have a lot of front end knowledge, I've made static pages with html and css, but haven't got into js.
I am actively learning about how components, controllers, routers, and interactivity works with websites.
