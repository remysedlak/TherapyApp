# Project Overview

Spent the **2024 Winter break** hypothesizing and researching the current app development market. After evaluating several options, I decided to start with a **simple Django backend** and **React** for the frontend.

I am actively learning about how **components**, **controllers**, **routers**, and **interactivity** work in modern web applications.
