Spent 2024 Winter break hypothesizing and researching the current app development market.
After a long time of looking at the many options, I decided to start with a simple Django backend, and React, which is not so simple to me.
I have a lot of interest in developing software, but I wanted to explore this world of coding before I ignored it.

Current objectives:
- Create components for entries, days, calender
- Create proper navigation and routing between pages
- Extend backend to have more API features
