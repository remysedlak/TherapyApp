Spent 2024 Winter break hypothesizing and researching the current app development market.
After a long time of looking at the many options, I decided to start with a simple Django backend, and React, which is not so simple to me.

Current objectives:
- Create components for entries, days, calender
- Create proper navigation and routing between pages
- Extend backend to have more API features
